For a program to be useful, it usually needs to communicate with the outside world by obtaining input data from the user and displaying result data back to the user. Input may come from the user directly through the keyboard or from external sources like files or databases. Output can be displayed directly to the console or IDE, to the screen through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), or again to an external source.
